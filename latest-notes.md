    1. On sales detail page

        <!-- 1. Transaction amounts are not floats -->

        <!-- 2. Need navigation back to sales history page -->

    2. Sales page:

        <!-- 1. After adding product, amounts are not floats -->

        2. After adding product, shows subtotal times quantity, not product price x quantity

        <!-- 3. Total is not a float -->

        <!-- 4. Total is rounded down to int it appears -->

        <!-- 5. Grand total not a float -->

        <!-- 6. Transaction amount is not a float (top right) -->

        <!-- 7. For cash, cash given is not a float -->

        <!-- 8. For cash, change due is not a float -->

        **** <!-- 9. After completing, transaction amount populated with email (chrome autofill) -->  ****

        <!-- 10. Able to apply transactions even when grand total is $0 -->

        <!-- 11. Able to complete transaction even if not enough cash given -->

    3. Corporate account

        <!-- 1. Adding new shows credit card. Should only show if that is the payment method selected -->

        2. Only one date available to be valid. Should be date range

    4. Settings

        <!-- 1. Not able to update tax rate -->

    5. Reservations->admin add

        <!-- 1. Price, tax, and total are not floats -->

    6. Product type add

        <!-- 1. Creating product type is possible without choosing a group first (and when this happens group shows as deleted) -->

        <!-- 2. Created myself a profile and logged in and cannot delete (no prompt or anything) -->

        <!-- 3. Second time logged in and trying now get a manager pin override but my pin isn't accepted (originally product created under your login) -->

    <!-- 7. Creating scheduled product → maybe we should meet about this section in person to discuss? -->

    <!-- 1. Need time group to associate with different tours products (now looks like time is associated with the product type) -->

    <!-- 2. When creating a tour product, individual times are selected as modifiers? -->

    3. Creating a time: use dropdown of hours and minutes and am/pm instead of text input? (not critical now)

    <!-- 4. No individual scheduled products available when booking? Uses product types? -->

    8. Reservation add:

        <!-- 1. No way to cancel out of an admin reservation. No nav either so have to use back arrow of browser -->

        2. Formatting on reservation detail page is weird (email and phone number overlap unless mobile view)

        <!-- 3. I booked one guest (me as registrant), and ended up with two slots filled for me → is primary still required slot? -->

        4. Admin should have way to remove a guest from a reservation and open that slot back up

        <!-- 5. Admin should have a way to delete a reservation group (say they call and cancel because plans changed) -->
